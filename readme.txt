This REST interface is a simple API that allows clients to start and stop the animation of a pendulum, and to retrieve or update the data for the pendulum. The API listens on multiple ports, and stores the pendulum data in JSON files, one file per port. The API has two main routes:

/start: This route starts the animation of the pendulum by running a loop that updates the pendulum's state and writes the updated data to the appropriate JSON file. The loop is implemented using setInterval.
/stop: This route stops the animation of the pendulum by flipping a boolean flag, which causes the loop to terminate.
The API also has the following methods:

GET: This method allows clients to retrieve the data for the pendulum on a particular port. The data is returned in JSON format.
POST: This method allows clients to send new data to the pendulum on a particular port. If the route is not /start or /stop, the data is written to the appropriate JSON file.
The API uses the http module to create an HTTP server and handle HTTP requests, and the request and fs modules to read and write files. The path module is also used to work with file paths.
